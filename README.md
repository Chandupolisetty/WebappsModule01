# Cristiano Ronaldo

Cristiano Ronaldo was born on 5th February 1985 is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Serie A club Juventus and captains the Portugal national team. Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. He is also known as THE G.O.A.T(Greatest Of All Time) and he is called as CR7
## His Early life
Cristiano Ronaldo was born in Sao Pedro, Funchal, on the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in Santo Antonio, Funchal. He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores a cook, and Jose Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener and a part-time kit man. Ronaldo grew up in a Catholic and impoverished home, sharing a room with all his siblings.
## His Career
### Manchester United
Ronaldo became Manchester United's first-ever Portuguese player when he signed before the 2003–04 season. His transfer fee of £12.24 million made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history. Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.
